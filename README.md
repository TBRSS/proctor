### _Paul M. Rodriguez <pmr@ruricolist.com>_

Proctor is a new Common Lisp test framework. How is it different from
the many existing Common Lisp test frameworks? It treats tests as build targets. You can very precisely specify the dependencies of a test – from system versions to files to individual Lisp bindings and OS environment variables – and the test, once passed, will only be re-run if those dependencies change.
